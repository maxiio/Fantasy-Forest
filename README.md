### Description
This is a project that seeks to emulate a typical fantasy forest seen early on in an MMORPG. Each character is an autonomous agent that react to each other's actions. Butterflies flock to flowers, footmen follow their path, while spiders wander and flee.

### Controls
Use 'Q' and 'E' to shift between the camera views.
